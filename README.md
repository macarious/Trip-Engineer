## 2. Features

### Generate New Plan

The "Generate New Plan" page is where the magic happens. Here, you can effortlessly create a new vacation plan tailored to your preferences. Simply provide your desired location, duration (up to 4 days), arrival time, departure time, and select your preferred mode of transportation (car or transit).

### View Saved Plans

The "Saved Plans" page offers a comprehensive overview of all the plans you've generated. Each plan is summarized to give you a quick glance at its contents. If you want to dive deeper into a specific plan, just click the "View" button. If you wish to remove a saved plan, simply click "Delete". Additionally, you have the ability to add tags to your saved plans for better organization. By clicking the "Pencil" icon, you can enter tag edit mode, where you can add new tags or delete existing ones. To exit tag edit mode, click the "Return" button. It's important to note that any unsaved changes will be discarded upon returning.

- Trip durations are currently limited to a maximum of 4 days.
- Additional parameters beyond location, duration, arrival/departure time, and transportation mode are not taken into account.
- Tags currently do not interact with each other, but they can still help you organize your plans effectively.
